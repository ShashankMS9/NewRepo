This program lets you select files on your computer, add tags to describe what type of files it is (for example, for a copy of your auto insurnace policy ofr 2021, "auto", "insurance", "2021"), encrypt the files, and move them to a common location.

It currently only runs locally, using MS SQL Server as the database and saving the encrypted files to a local directory.

The plan is to allow different, lighter-weight, databases and store locally, on a network share, and/or cloud storage (e.g., AWS or Azure).
